# Global Applications

- A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
- ON AWS: deployed in multiple regions and/ or edge locations
  - Edge Locations: for content delivery as close as possible to users.

## Why?

- Decreased Latency = less time for a network packet to reach a server
- Disaster Recovery (DR): If an AWS region goes down(eatherquake...) you can fail over to another region.
  - increased availibility
- Attack protection: Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack (hackers)
