# Serverless

- A serverless service is where you don't manage, provision or even see the servers that are used.
- A new paradigm in which developers don't have to manage servers anymore thay just deploy the code or functions.
- Pioneered by AWS Lambda but now alos includes anything that's managed.
-  e.g. Amazon S3, Dynamo DB, Fargate.
